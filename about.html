        <p>Session 1 (Interactive) – Graduate student consortium and poster session (120 minutes) 
            The purpose of the graduate student consortium is to provide opportunities for direct interactions between students and researchers in the biomedical and clinical NLP field, so that students can 1) refine their research focus; 2) discuss specific questions about study design, algorithm development, or evaluation plan; 3) receive constructive feedback and suggestions about their dissertation work; and 4) establish possible collaborations. Informal feedback from students at previous years’ doctoral consortia was very positive.
            Building on our past doctoral consortia, a call for submissions will invite graduate students to submit abstracts for a podium presentation of their graduate research work (in the biomedical and clinical NLP fields). Four selected students will each have 15 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for discussion with a panel of established experts and researchers in biomedical and clinical NLP. The well-established NLP researchers will serve on the committee. (Ozlem Uzuner, Bridget Thomson-McInnes, Meliha Yetisgen, Hongfang Liu, Hua Xu, Stephane Meystre, Chunhua Weng, Timothy Miller, and the organizers.)
            </p><p>
            Session 2 – State-of-the-art biomedical and clinical NLP (120 minutes) 
            A selection of existing and significant NLP related efforts will be highlighted in this session. A call for submissions will invite researchers to submit their significant research effort including research studies (published, in press or under development projects), tools, resources, events, and community shared tasks in the past 12 months. The presenters will identify themselves as the corresponding authors during the submission process, and accepted presenters are required to make the presentation themselves.
            All NLP year-in-review submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
            •	Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to NLP-WG,
            •	Impact of the paper(s) on informatics/medicine/biology (while the impact of papers on science is not fully reflected by ISI/Google-like impact factors or high number of downloads, high values in such factors will clearly stand as a strong argument for acceptance),
            •	"Presentability" of the work to a large, diverse audience,
            •	Quality of oral presentations by the submitter (if known),
            •	Submissions that permit the presentation of related interesting unpublished new results will be viewed favorably.
            These "soft" criteria attempt to capture the underlying goal of the Highlight session, namely the presentation of exciting and thought-provoking efforts in advancing NLP in the biomedical land clinical domain. The purpose of the presentations and demonstrations is to provide opportunities for the biomedical and clinical NLP community to discover and share state-of-the-art knowledge, and eventually encourage scientific and technical progress in the field. Six submissions will be selected to give a 15-minute presentation followed by a 5-minute Q&A. 
        </p><p>
            Session 3 (Interactive) – NLP for Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health (120 minutes)
            Social and behavior determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions under which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, and include factors such as socioeconomic status, education, employment, lifestyles, social support networks, access to medical care, and neighborhood characteristics. These factors also have a major impact on health equity. With the passing of the HITECH Act in 2009, there has been increased emphasis on use of EHRs to document SDOH. While SDOH exist in structured EHRs, SDOH are primarily documented in free-text clinical notes. NLP is the key technology to extract SDOH from clinical notes and make such information useful for clinical and translational research. This panel will encompass the current research and issues of NLP technologies for extracting and using SDOH from EHRs to facilitate clinical and translational research and to improve clinical care and health equity. The panelist includes Dr. Rui Zhang from the University of Minnesota, Dr. Masoud Rouhizadeh from the University of Florida, Dr. Yanshan Wang from the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Meliha Yetisgen from the University of Washington, Dr. Elham Hatef from the Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Alec Chapman from the University of Utah. Dr. Kirk Roberts from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston will moderate this session. Each panelist will have 10 minutes to present, followed by 60 minutes interactive discussion.
